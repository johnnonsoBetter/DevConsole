## Data Collection

### What We Collect

DevConsole collects the following types of data **locally on your device only**:

1. **Console Logs & Network Requests** - Captured from websites you are actively debugging
2. **API Keys** - User-provided keys for AI services, GitHub, and Unsplash (stored locally in Chrome storage)
3. **User Preferences** - Extension settings and configurations
4. **Sticky Notes** - Notes you create and attach to web pages

### What We Do NOT Collect

## Data Storage

All data is stored **locally** on your device using Chrome's built-in storage APIs. No data is transmitted to our servers.

## Third-Party Services

When you explicitly configure and use these features, data may be sent to:

- **AI Providers** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) - Only when you click "Explain with AI"
- **GitHub API** - Only when you create or view issues
- **Unsplash API** - Only when you use image autofill

These transmissions only occur when you actively trigger them and require your own API keys.

## Data Security
